* What is Cursor?
  * Cursor is a database object used by applications to manipulate data in a set on a row-by-row basis, instead of the typical SQL commands that operate on all the rows in the set at one time.
  * In order to work with a cursor we need to perform some steps in the following order:
    * Declare cursor
    * Open cursor
    * Fetch row from the cursor
    * Process fetched row
    * Close cursor
    * Deallocate cursor (Read More Here)
* What is Collation?
  * Collation refers to a set of rules that determine how data is sorted and compared. Character data is sorted using rules that define the correct character sequence, with options for specifying case sensitivity, accent marks, kana character types and character width. (Read More Here)
* What is Difference between Function and Stored Procedure?
  * UDF can be used in the SQL statements anywhere in the WHERE/HAVING/SELECT section where as Stored procedures cannot be. UDFs that return tables can be treated as another rowset. This can be used in JOINs with other tables. Inline UDF’s can be thought of as views that take parameters and can be used in JOINs and other Rowset operations.
* What is sub-query? Explain properties of sub-query?
  * Sub-queries are often referred to as sub-selects, as they allow a SELECT statement to be executed arbitrarily within the body of another SQL statement. A sub-query is executed by enclosing it in a set of parentheses. Sub-queries are generally used to return a single row as an atomic value, though they may be used to compare values against multiple rows with the IN keyword.
  * A subquery is a SELECT statement that is nested within another T-SQL statement. A subquery SELECT statement if executed independently of the T-SQL statement, in which it is nested, will return a resultset. Meaning a subquery SELECT statement can standalone and is not depended on the statement in which it is nested. A subquery SELECT statement can return any number of values, and can be found in, the column list of a SELECT statement, a FROM, GROUP BY, HAVING, and/or ORDER BY clauses of a T-SQL statement. A Subquery can also be used as a parameter to a function call. Basically a subquery can be used anywhere an expression can be used. (Read More Here)
* What are different Types of Join?
  * Cross Join
    * A cross join that does not have a WHERE clause produces the Cartesian product of the tables involved in the join. The size of a Cartesian product result set is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table. The common example is when company wants to combine each product with a pricing table to analyze each product at each price.
  * Inner Join
    * A join that displays only the rows that have a match in both joined tables is known as inner Join.  This is the default type of join in the Query and View Designer.
  * Outer Join
    * A join that includes rows even if they do not have related rows in the joined table is an Outer Join.  You can create three different outer join to specify the unmatched rows to be included:
  * Left Outer Join: 
    * In Left Outer Join all rows in the first-named table i.e. “left” table, which appears leftmost in the JOIN clause are included. Unmatched rows in the right table do not appear. 
  * Right Outer Join: 
    * In Right Outer Join all rows in the second-named table i.e. “right” table, which appears rightmost in the JOIN clause are included. Unmatched rows in the left table are not included.
  * Full Outer Join: 
    * In Full Outer Join all rows in all joined tables are included, whether they are matched or not.
  * Self Join
    * This is a particular case when one table joins to itself, with one or two aliases to avoid confusion. A self join can be of any type, as long as the joined tables are the same. A self join is rather unique in that it involves a relationship with only one table. The common example is when company has a hierarchal reporting structure whereby one member of staff reports to another. Self Join can be Outer Join or Inner Join. (Read More Here)
* What are primary keys and foreign keys?
  * Primary keys are the unique identifiers for each row. They must contain unique values and cannot be null. Due to their importance in relational databases, Primary keys are the most fundamental of all keys and constraints. A table can have only one Primary key.
  * Foreign keys are both a method of ensuring data integrity and a manifestation of the relationship between tables.
  * [Difference between Primary key and Unique key - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-primary-key-and-unique-key/)
    * Key Differences Between Primary key and Unique key: 
      * Primary key will not accept NULL values whereas Unique key can accept NULL values.
      * A table can have only primary key whereas there can be multiple unique key on a table.
      * A Clustered index automatically created when a primary key is defined whereas Unique key generates the non-clustered index.

|Parameter |	PRIMARY KEY |	UNIQUE KEY|
|-|-|-|
|	Basic	|	Used to serve as a unique identifier for each row in a table.	|	Uniquely determines a row which isn’t primary key.|	
|	NULL value acceptance	|	Cannot accept NULL values.	|	Can accepts NULL values.|	
|	Number of keys that can be defined in the table	|	Only one primary key	|	More than one unique key|	
|	Index	|	Creates clustered index	|	Creates non-clustered index|

* What is User Defined Functions? What kind of User-Defined Functions can be created?
  * User-Defined Functions allow defining its own T-SQL functions that can accept 0 or more parameters and return a single scalar data value or a table data type.
  * Different Kinds of User-Defined Functions created are: 
    * Scalar User-Defined Function
      * A Scalar user-defined function returns one of the scalar data types. Text, ntext, image and timestamp data types are not supported. These are the type of user-defined functions that most developers are used to in other programming languages. You pass in 0 to many parameters and you get a return value.
    * Inline Table-Value User-Defined Function
      * An Inline Table-Value user-defined function returns a table data type and is an exceptional alternative to a view as the user-defined function can pass parameters into a T-SQL select command and in essence provide us with a parameterized, non-updateable view of the underlying tables.
    * Multi-statement Table-Value User-Defined Function
      * A Multi-Statement Table-Value user-defined function returns a table and is also an exceptional alternative to a view as the function can support multiple T-SQL statements to build the final result where the view is limited to a single SELECT statement. Also, the ability to pass parameters into a TSQL select command or a group of them gives us the capability to in essence create a parameterized, non-updateable view of the data in the underlying tables. Within the create function command you must define the table structure that is being returned. After creating this type of user-defined function, It can be used in the FROM clause of a T-SQL command unlike the behavior found when using a stored procedure which can also return record sets. (Read Here For Example)
* What is Identity?
  * Identity (or AutoNumber) is a column that automatically generates numeric values. A start and increment value can be set, but most DBA leave these at 1. A GUID column also generates numbers; the value of this cannot be controlled. Identity/GUID columns do not need to be indexed.
* What is DataWarehousing?
  * Subject-oriented, meaning that the data in the database is organized so that all the data elements relating to the same real-world event or object are linked together;
  * Time-variant, meaning that the changes to the data in the database are tracked and recorded so that reports can be produced showing changes over time;
  * Non-volatile, meaning that data in the database is never over-written or deleted, once committed, the data is static, read-only, but retained for future reporting.
  * Integrated, meaning that the database contains data from most or all of an organization’s operational applications, and that this data is made consistent.

### Understanding of table, view and index.
Given tables as follows:

T1
Col1 Col2
1 10
2 20
3 20
4 30
5 30
6 30

T2
Col1 Col2
1 10
2 20
3 30
4 40
5 50
6 60

1. Please write a query based on T1 and T2 which produces:

2 20
3 20
3 30
4 30
4 40
5 30
5 50
6 30
6 60
(Hint: the result set is produced from merging T1 and T2 together, without duplicate values)

2. Please write a query based on T1 which produces:

Col2

20

30

Note that DON'T use hard coded 'where clause' to simply 'select distinct col2 from t1 where col2 = 20 or col2 = 30'.

( Hint: 20 and 30 apprear more than once in col2 of T1)

3. Please write the result of the following query:
select A.col1, B.col1, A.col2, B.col2 from T1 A FULL OUTER JOIN T2 B ON (A.col2 = B.col2);

4. Please list the database objects you know (for example, table is one of the objects). Describe how to use them and why do you use them.

5. How many kinds of keys in database? How to use them?

6. We want to prevent the users from inserting the values larger than 100 for col1 in T1 (above table). How do you do that?

7. User A is doing some modifications on T1, and he does not want other users to know what he has changed until he commit all his work. What options could he have?

8. How to return values from a store procedure? How to return result set from a store procedure?

9. How do I add another column Col3 to T1, with data type integer and default value 100?

10. Describe how to use 'CURSOR' in SQL procedure. Please write a procedure that uses CURSOR to return result set with 'select col1 from t1'.
